# dataLab

In dataLab.c you will find 12 functions that implement various tasks with bitwise operators alone. Each function has a description written above its header. Each function increases in complexity, and demonstrates basic operations possible with bitwise operators. The functions implemented include: bitOr, evenBits, minusOne, allEvenBits, anyOddBit, byteSwap, addOK, conditional, isAsciiDigit, replaceByte, rotateRight, and satAdd.
